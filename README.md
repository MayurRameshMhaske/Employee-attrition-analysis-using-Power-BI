# Employee-attrition-analysis-using-Power-BI
Mini project on - 'Employee attrition analysis using Power BI'.
From the dashboard we can infer the following insights:
- Total number of employees and other attributes.
- Life Sciences graduates have highest attrition rate
- Also the employees from age group 26-35 are the most who left the organization
- Also the employees who have salary less than 5k and served the organization for the period of 1 year, are also high in numbers in terms of attrition.
Other attributes we can see in the dashboard, we can also filter the dashboard department wise(HR, R&D, Sales).
